# Birds

The purpose of this project is to access the the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird API 
and display bird observation data found in an area using geolocation (for the browser) 
and the google maps API. The google map can be double-clicked to display any available bird 
observation data for the new area. The website can be viewed at https://taksnapdrgn.com/birds
